# Official LinQ Unity SDK

ðŸ›  In order for us to provide optimal support, we would kindly ask you to submit any issues to [support@galactica.games](mailto:support@galactica.games) or [create an issue](https://github.com/linqgg/unity-sdk/issues/new).

> When submitting an issue please specify your game identifier (asset), production steps, logs, code snippets, and any additional relevant information.

## Overview

This SDK and list of helpers inside allow you to implement native payments in your Unity game, using our infrastructure for anti-fraud checks and tokenization cards. We encapsulate different libraries and external APIs inside and provide convenient and simple APIs for processing user payments.

Also, we provide additional services for quick checks of user location, or in which country they have an account in the App Store for better tunning user experience. The set of such functions will be adjusted with time.

## Requirements

The current version is written and tested on Unity version **2021.3** and release **26f1**. Later versions should be supported too, but [create an issue](./link-to-new-issue) if any difficulty appears.

Unity SDK uses [External Dependency Manager for Unity (EDM4U)](https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver) from Google for managing native libraries required for work, including CocoaPod binaries for iOS. This manager should be installed via Package Manager before SDK is installed, as Unity can not automatically resolve dependencies from external sources except its own.

For work with JSON, which is required for web-request to external APIs need to install a special [JSON.NET package](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) from Newtonsoft.

## Installation

Before installing SDK, be sure that you have installed the required packages, using `Window > Package Manager`.

EDM4U can be installed via the command line using the prompt `openupm add com.google.external-dependency-manager` or need to manually add [Scoped Registry](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-scoped.html) in `Player Setting > Package Manager` (see screenshot).

Or you can manually edit the config in `Packages/manifest.json` using the next config:

```json
"scopedRegistries": [
  {
    "name": "package.openupm.com",
    "url": "https://package.openupm.com",
    "scopes": [
      "com.google.external-dependency-manager"
    ]
  }
]
```

## Getting Started

To start using SDK need to configure it and initialize it. SDK sends requests to our backend under the hood which requires authentification for requests. We provide a special Mobile SDK Secret Key for each game, that has to be set up in the SDK config.

### Setup

Configuration stored in the special asset, that has to be placed by the path `Assets/Resources/Settings/LinqSettings.asset`. For quick setup we provide an Editor menu, so to start configuring SDK you have to select `LinQ > Edit Settings` and set `Remote URL` and `Secret Key`.

![linq-unity-sdk-setup-2](https://github.com/linqgg/unity-sdk/assets/303498/77d1fbf5-6cb3-4f90-85b8-c2158d87bc16)

> Remote URL for the stage is `https://services.stage.galactica.games` when for production the same, except `staging` word, i.e.: `https://services.galactica.games`.

To initialize SDK we provide a special Initializer, which has to be placed on the game scene. To add it to the scene use menu `LinQ > Create Initializer`.

In case you are using your system for configuring the game, you may initialize the SDK manually, providing proper details.

```scharp
LinqSDK.InitSDK("https://services.stage.galactica.games", "secret-key");
```

### Usage

To use SDK you need to prepare card data and billing address, that the user provided via your own UX elements. We do not require any additional steps here, except the rule that card data should not be transferred to any game backend service as it will break PCI DCI policy.

Also, before processing payment you have to initiate payment intent, which can be done via backend API with the method `putReplenishOrder`. The method will return `order.id`, that is intent identifier itself.

To proceed with SDK collect the data as in the example, please:

```csharp
// Card Details
var details = new PaymentDetails()
{
  CardNumber = "4242424242424242",
  Expiration = "12/27",
  HolderName = "Kevon Chang",
  Protection = "123",
};

// Billing Address
var address = new BillingAddress()
{
  Country = "US", // 2-letter code
  Region = "Iowa",
  City = "Iowa City",
  Street = "109 S Johnson St",
  Zip = "52240"
};
```

> Note, that country has to be converted into a 2-letter code according to [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2).

According to the billing address, we require only **country**, **state**2520 (for USA), and **postal code**. Please consider it during the implementation of UI validation in the game.

The latest step is to pass collected data into SDK, which will return the replenishment order with the appropriate status when payment is successful.

### Processing Payments

API allows running the checkout process via ordinary card and using Apple Pay when it is supported (on iOS devices).

```csharp
// Ordinary Card
var order = await LinqSDK.CheckoutByOrdinaryCard(order, details, address);
Debug.Log("Order status: " + order.Status);
```

```csharp
// Apple Pay Card
var order = await LinqSDK.CheckoutByApplePayCard(order);
Debug.Log("Order status: " + order.Status);
```

### Error Handling

In case the SDK request fails it generates an appropriate exception with an error message. To avoid hanging, you must handle such exceptions using `try/catch` constructions.

```csharp
try {
  var response = await LinqSDK.CheckoutByOrdinaryCard(order, details, address);
  Debug.Log("Success: " + response.Status);
} catch (InvalidOperationException e) {
  Debug.Log("Failure: " + e.Message);
}
```

ApplePay part works the same way but provides more custom exceptions. 

- `PaymentFailureException` â€“ when payment was authorized by the user but failed on the provider side. 
- `PaymentDiscardException` â€“ when a user closes the Apple Pay payment sheet.
- `PaymentUnknownException` â€“ when ApplePay is not supported on the device (applicable for Unity Editor as well).

```
try {
  var response = await LinqSDK.CheckoutByApplePayCard(order);
  // Success
} catch (PaymentUnknownException e) {
  Debug.Log("Unknown: " + e.Message);
  // do nothing
} catch (PaymentFailureException e) {
  Debug.Log("Failure: " + e.Message);
  // show a message to the user that payment has failed
} catch (PaymentDiscardException e) {
  Debug.Log("Discard: " + e.Message);
  // handle logic about cancellation
}
```

### Testing & Validation

For testing purposes, you can use the following card credentials for ordinary card payment:

- Number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Expriration: `12/2027`
- Holder Name: `CARD HOLDER`
- CVV Code: `123`

In some cases, native modules, that are used under the hood, may not work. It may happen when the game runs on Android or from Unity Editor. To not block the flow it is possible to skip anti-fraud checks by providing the word `NOFRAUD` in the field of the cardholder name.

For Apple Pay testing, you need to create [special testing account](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/sandbox-testing/) and add there the next card details. Authorization may work with any cards and accounts, but transactions will fail on the provider side.

- Number: `5204 2452 5000 1488`
- Expriration: `11/2022`
- CVV Code: `111`
